# Face-Detector

The goal of this project is to run a machine learning algorithm to detect when and which individual enters a room. I will place a Raspberry Pi attached with a camera and a microphone facing the door. The facial detection algorithm will then observe when someone walks in, and output a curated message based on their identity.
